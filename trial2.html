            <p>Mozilla’s work with AI isn’t just a new thing—we’ve spent years funding, building and advocating for
                AI that’s open, fair and developed responsibly. Our focus is on creating AI that serves the people,
                prioritises transparency and supports the public good, not corporate agendas.</p>

            <p>At its core, Mozilla is an activist organisation led by the Mozilla Foundation that makes change in
                the world through a variety of ventures including Mozilla Corporation, MZLA, <a href="#">Mozilla
                    Ventures</a> and <a href="#">Mozilla AI</a> . How are we different? Because we’re
                mission-driven, it means we have the freedom to make all of our decisions based on what’s best for
                the internet and for everyone online, not based on the demands of shareholders — we don’t actually
                have any of those.</p>
